Solution Architecture Diagram

The solution architecture consists of the following components:

1. Data Processing and Model Training (Local/Development Environment)
   - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
   - Model training (SVM and Logistic Regression)
   - Model evaluation and selection

2. Web Application (AWS EC2 or Lambda)
   - Flask web application with HTML/CSS frontend
   - Model inference endpoint

3. Deployment Environment (AWS)
   - API Gateway for request routing
   - EC2/Lambda/ECS for hosting the application
   - CloudWatch for monitoring and logging

# Data Flow:
1. User inputs client data through web form
2. Flask application receives form data
3. Application preprocesses input data using saved pipeline
4. Preprocessed data is fed to the trained model
5. Model returns prediction (yes/no) and probability
6. Result is displayed to the user

# AWS Hosting Options Comparison

## Option 1: Amazon EC2

### Pros:
- Full control over the environment
- Can be scaled horizontally with Auto Scaling Groups
- Suitable for applications with consistent traffic
- Better for applications requiring more computational resources

### Cons:
- Requires more management (security, updates, etc.)
- Continuous cost regardless of usage
- More complex setup

### Recommended when:
- You need full control over the infrastructure
- The application has consistent, predictable traffic
- You have specific OS or software requirements

## Option 2: AWS Lambda

### Pros:
- Serverless - no server management required
- Pay-per-use pricing model (cost-effective for sporadic usage)
- Automatic scaling
- Easy integration with other AWS services

### Cons:
- Cold start issues might affect performance
- Limited execution time (15 minutes max)
- Limited computational resources
- Not ideal for applications requiring persistent connections

### Recommended when:
- Traffic is sporadic or unpredictable
- Cost optimization is important
- Simple deployment process is preferred
- The prediction process is relatively quick

## Option 3: Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)

### Pros:
- Container-based deployment (Docker)
- Consistent environment across development and production
- More flexible than Lambda but less management than EC2
- Good for microservices architecture

### Cons:
- More complex than Lambda
- Requires container management
- Higher cost than Lambda for low-traffic applications

### Recommended when:
- You want to use containers for deployment consistency
- The application might scale to become more complex
- You want a balance between control and management overhead

## Recommendation for this Use Case:

For this bank marketing prediction application, **AWS Lambda** is the recommended option because:

1. Predictions are lightweight and can be completed within Lambda's time limits
2. Traffic is likely to be sporadic (not constant throughout the day)
3. Pay-per-use model is cost-effective for this type of application
4. Lambda simplifies deployment and scaling
5. Easy integration with API Gateway for the web interface

If the model becomes more complex or requires more computational resources, transitioning to ECS would be the next logical step.

# CI/CD Pipeline for Bank Marketing Prediction App

## CI/CD Pipeline Components:

1. **Source Control Repository**
   - GitHub or AWS CodeCommit

2. **CI/CD Service**
   - AWS CodePipeline with CodeBuild

3. **Testing**
   - Unit Tests
   - Integration Tests
   - Model Performance Tests

4. **Deployment**
   - AWS CodeDeploy or CloudFormation
